## **✨About Me**

I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T). Motivated by a passion for science, personal growth, and the pursuit of becoming a researcher, I bring an interdisciplinary background that bridges engineering, finance, and computer science.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Communication Engineering and a Master’s degree in Finance, but during my previous career I discovered a strong interest in coding and artificial intelligence. Driven by curiosity, I self-taught Python, Java, C++, and core computer science fundamentals before beginning my graduate studies at Missouri S&T.

My coursework has focused on deep learning, machine learning, and mathematical foundations—including Probability and Application in Computing—which together provide a strong basis for advanced research in AI. Since September 2024, I have also been a research member of the Human-Centered AI Lab, advised by Dr. Huiyuan Yang, where I contribute to projects at the intersection of time series forecasting, natural language processing, reasoning, and trustworthy AI. Guided by curiosity and determination, I continue to deepen my expertise in these areas with the goal of advancing meaningful and impactful research.

## **✨Research Interests**

My research interests focus on advancing NLP and enhancing LLM reasoning, building trustworthy models, and integrating time series forecasting.

## **✨Community**

Beyond research, I contribute to the international student community, helping peers adapt to academic life in the U.S. and actively engaging in cross-cultural initiatives at Missouri S&T.

## **✨Personal**

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, with a particular interest in classical political philosophy. I also stay active through regular exercise at the gym and outdoor hiking, which help me maintain balance and creativity in both life and research.
