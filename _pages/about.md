## **✨About Me**

I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T). Motivated by a passion for science, personal growth, and the pursuit of becoming a researcher, I bring an interdisciplinary background that bridges engineering, finance, and computer science.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Communication Engineering and a Master’s degree in Finance, but during my previous career I discovered a strong interest in coding and artificial intelligence. Driven by curiosity, I self-taught Python, Java, C++, and core computer science fundamentals before beginning my graduate studies at Missouri S&T.

I have built a strong foundation in computer science through coursework such as Natural Language Processing, Analysis of Algorithms, Introduction to Deep Learning, Foundations of Data Management, Scientific Programming with Python, Introduction to Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and Probability and Applications in Computing. Together, these courses have equipped me with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills across algorithms, programming, and AI.

Since September 2024, I have also been a research member of the Human-Centered AI Lab, advised by Dr. Huiyuan Yang, where I contribute to projects at the intersection of time series forecasting, natural language processing, reasoning, and trustworthy AI. In addition, under the guidance of Dr. Suman Maity in my NLP course, I worked on the SciTable project, which has led to a manuscript in preparation and further strengthened my research experience in scientific data processing and text generation. Guided by curiosity and determination, I continue to deepen my expertise in these areas with the goal of advancing meaningful and impactful research.

## **✨Research Interests**

My research interests span NLP, ML, AI, and HCI. I aim to build human-centered technologies that address real-world challenges and advance AI for social good

## **✨Community**

Beyond research, I contribute to the international student community, helping peers adapt to academic life in the U.S. and actively engaging in cross-cultural initiatives at Missouri S&T.

## **✨Personal**

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, with a particular interest in classical political philosophy. I also stay active through regular exercise at the gym and outdoor hiking, which help me maintain balance and creativity in both life and research.
