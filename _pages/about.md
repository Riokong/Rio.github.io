👨‍💻 About Me

I am a final-year graduate student in Computer Science at Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T), specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Motivated by a passion for science, personal growth, and the pursuit of becoming a researcher, I bring an interdisciplinary background that combines engineering, finance, and computer science.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Communication Engineering and a Master’s degree in Finance, but during my previous career I discovered a strong interest in coding and artificial intelligence. Driven by curiosity, I self-taught Python, Java, C++, and core computer science fundamentals before beginning my graduate studies at Missouri S&T.

My coursework has focused on deep learning, machine learning, and mathematical foundations—including Probability and Application in Computing—which together provide a strong basis for advanced research in AI.

🔬 Research

My research centers on building trustworthy AI systems for scientific text and table understanding, with recent work involving large-scale dataset creation and evaluation frameworks.

🌎 Community

Beyond research, I contribute to the international student community, helping peers adapt to academic life in the U.S. and actively engaging in cross-cultural initiatives at Missouri S&T.
