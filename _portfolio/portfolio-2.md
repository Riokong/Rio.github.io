**Project Overview**  
Cross-domain implementation of **SCI_Reason** from medical → **financial** literature and reports, adding **Monte Carlo Tree Search** for chain-of-thought reasoning.

**My Contributions**  
- Implemented a multimodal reasoning pipeline for financial papers and market docs.  
- Integrated MCTS; designed domain-specific reasoning templates (achieved **0.84+ quality**).  
- Automated evaluation + scalable batch processing; **~1000× faster** vs LLM-only baselines.

**Tech**: Python, LLaMA-3-70B, LLaVA-1.6-7B, SciBERT, spaCy
