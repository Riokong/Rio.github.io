excerpt: 'Generating coherent and factually grounded text from structured data remains a core challenge in natural language generation, with critical applications in scientific communication, medical documentation, and automated reporting. However, existing datasets predominantly emphasize open-domain or simplified table formats, limiting progress in complex, high-stakes domains.We introduce SciTables, a new dataset and framework for scientific table-to-text generation that addresses this gap. SciTables is constructed from peer-reviewed Computer Science papers on arXiv (2017–2023) and contains complex tables rich in numeric and symbolic content paired with naturally occurring textual descriptions. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on manual annotation, our approach employs a scalable, semi-automated pipeline to extract, clean, and align tables with their associated text, preserving domain-specific language while minimizing annotation costs.The resulting benchmark poses realistic challenges for current models and enables rigorous evaluation of factuality, coherence, and domain adaptation. We further conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art generation models and evaluation strategies—including LLMs-as-judges and embedding-based semantic metrics—providing insights into model performance in high-precision scientific settings. Our work lays a foundation for developing more faithful and informative table-to-text systems in specialized domains.'
